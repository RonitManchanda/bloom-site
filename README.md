<![CDATA[# 🌸 Bloom

**The match that moves you forward.**

Bloom is a mentorship matchmaking platform that connects students and early-career professionals with mentors through mutual opt-in — no cold outreach, no awkward LinkedIn DMs.

---

## ✨ What is Bloom?

Mentorship is one of the strongest career accelerators, yet access is informal, network-dependent, and biased toward people already "in the loop."

Bloom fixes this by treating mentorship like modern dating apps treat relationships: intentional matching based on relevance, goals, and mutual interest.

### Core Principles

- **Access over awareness** — Great mentors shouldn't be hidden behind networks
- **Mutual opt-in** — Both sides choose each other before connecting
- **Remote-first** — Your perfect mentor might be anywhere in the world
- **Low friction, high trust** — Verified profiles and clear expectations

## 🎯 Who is this for?

| User Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Mentees** | Students and early-career professionals seeking guidance |
| **Mentors** | Mid- to senior-level professionals open to giving back |
| **Hybrid** | Users who mentor in one area while learning in another |
